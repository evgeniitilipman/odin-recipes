                        Favorite recipes of Scandinavian gods

                        Scandinavian gods are parents of famous vikings. Even before their human offsprings they were traveling the world, spreading havoc, gathering resources, and looting their victims. They were doing all that in order to find that perfect dish. Each god has a favorite. It is up to you, however to decide which dish is really the best.

                                    As a principal god of Scandinavia, Odin is known for being a wise guy. There is a saying, you are what you eat. And while it's not proven, Odin got his wisdom either by eating his ravens, (unlikely as they are always with him), or by eating Monkey Brains.
                                </p>

                                    Thor is super strong. I mean, he's the only one who can lift Mj√∂lnir. To get the strength to do so, he either eats lightning, or something that brings a similar punch. Something spicy. Yes, Spicy Asian Ramen Noodles.

                                    Freyja is a goddess associated with love, beauty, fertility, sex, war, gold. Obviously she's a gold digger. Her favorite must be Sesame Seared Bluefin Tuna and Sushi Bar Spinach Salad.

                                    Frigg is associated with marriage, prophecy, clairvoyance and motherhood. Obviously to stimulate motherhood she needs to increase testosterone in the males. Is why her favorite recipe is that of Marinated Flank Steak.
