        <li>
            2 cups cubed cooked chicken
        </li>
        <li>
            2 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodles with seasoning packet
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon lime juice
        </li>

        Steps
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add carrot, celery, and onion. Cook until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Add ginger and garlic. Cook 1 minute more. Add broth, soy sauce, basil, oregano, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until carrots are just tender about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in cooked chicken and ramen noodles. Simmer, uncovered, until noodles are tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in lime juice. Ladle soup into bowls. Sprinkle with lime zest and, if you like, additional basil and oregano leaves, and serve with Honey-Sriracha Crackers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 10x15-inch baking pan with foil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat canola oil and butter in a large saucepan over medium heat until butter is melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in honey, Sriracha, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the reserved ramen seasoning packet. Bring to a boil. Remove from heat and stir in oyster crackers. Toss together until evenly coated.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer crackers to the prepared pan and spread to an even layer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven, stirring once, until light golden and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool completely (crackers will continue to crisp as they cool). Store crackers in an airtight container at room temperature up to 2 weeks.
