        <li>

        <li>
            2 teaspoons vegetable oil

    <h2>
        Steps
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place spinach in a dry pot set over medium-high heat and cook, stirring, until it just begins to wilt, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer into a strainer to cool.        
        </li>
        <li>
            While spinach cools, toast white sesame seeds in a dry pan over medium heat until light golden brown. Transfer into a mortar and pestle and crush into a very coarse paste, leaving some seeds whole. Add white sugar, soy sauce, and mirin. Stir with a wooden spoon to combine and reserve.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer cooled spinach to a towel and squeeze out any excess liquid. Chop roughly and add to a mixing bowl. Add the dressing and mix well. Cover and chill thoroughly before serving.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix mayonnaise, miso paste, and rice vinegar together for miso mayo sauce. Place in the refrigerator until needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lightly salt tuna steaks, and then coat all sides well with as many sesame seeds as you like, pressing them lightly as you do.
        </li>
        <li>
            Brush a nonstick pan with oil and place over medium heat. Sear tuna steaks in the hot pan for 30 to 45 seconds on each side, as well as each edges.
        </li>
        <li>
            Slice and place tuna over the miso sauce. Brush tuna with ponzu and serve with spinach salad on the side.
        </li>
